Description:
    Stubs out a new controller and its views. Pass the controller name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments.

    The only difference from the regular controller generator is it creates
    views with file names ending with ".fbml.erb" instead of "html.erb".
Example:
    `./script/generate facebook_controller CreditCard open debit credit close`

    Credit card controller with URLs like /credit_card/debit.
        Controller: app/controllers/credit_card_controller.rb
        Views:      app/views/credit_card/debit.fbml.erb [...]
        Helper:     app/helpers/credit_card_helper.rb
        Test:       test/functional/credit_card_controller_test.rb
