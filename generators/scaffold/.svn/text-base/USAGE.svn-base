Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
    views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
    starting point for your restful, resource-oriented application.

    The following are the differences from the regular scaffold generator.
      * Views end with "fbml.erb" instead of "html.erb".
      * Functional tests use facebook_post, facebook_put, facebook_get, facebook_delete.
      * Controllers use the MIME type FBML instead of HTML.

Examples:
    `./script/generate facebook_scaffold post` # no attributes, view will be anemic
    `./script/generate facebook_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `./script/generate facebook_scaffold purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`
